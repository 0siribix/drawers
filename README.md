# Minetest Mod Storage Drawers
Version 0.1-dev, Status: alpha, License: MIT

## Description
This mod adds simple item storages showing the item's inventory image in the
front. By left- or right-clicking the image you can take or add stacks. If you
also hold the shift-key only a single item will be removed/added.

## Notes
This mod requires Minetest 0.4.14 or later. The `default` mod from MTG or the
MineClone 2 mods are only optional dependencies for crafting recipes.

## To-Do
- [ ] Add a drawer controller for auto-sorting items into a drawer-network
- [ ] Add half-sized drawers
- [ ] Add 2x2 and 1x2 drawers
- [ ] Add compacting drawers for auto-crafting blocks/ingots/fragments
